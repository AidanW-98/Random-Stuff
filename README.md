# What's this?

I'm not entirely sure; I wanted to share an internal SkyScanner blog to people outwith the company, so I set up this simple Jekyll site with GitHub Pages to host it. For now, this is all.

## Running Locally

Ensure you have Ruby (3.3.0) and Jekyll installed, then run:

```zsh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
